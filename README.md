# random-image-generation

## Description

This project is aimed towards the back end development of NFT image generation. In this project I am aiming to allow ease of use and allow easy customizability depending on the project; specifically how many NFT's are to be minted, how many layers to each NFT there are, and the probabilities associated with each asset.

## Installation
The following will need to be installed to run this.

```
pip install numpy imageio pillow
```

## Usage

Depending on integration with smart-contract deployment, you can generate the random images prior to deployment. Or call this back end function via the smart-contract. 

## Roadmap

Further development will be made to this project, specifically tying a SQLite database to ensure 1/1 uniqueness of images.
